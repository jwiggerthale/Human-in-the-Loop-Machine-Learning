When you run the script 'train_model_sequenially', this will create several directories 
In each  directory, there will be a json file that documents the manual labeling effort and acuracy per step in detail
We only uploaded one exemplary .csv file per model created when training models with seed 42 that contain the most relevant information: 
- runtime per configuration
- manual labeling effort per configuration
- accuracy per configuration
